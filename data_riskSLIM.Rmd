title: "data_riskSLIM"
output: html_notebook
---

In this notebook we convert the features_before_on (stored in expanded_features.Rdata) to a format suitable for riskSLIM, and convert to two csvs: a training set and a held out test (same as the one used in predict_recidivism.Rmd)

riskSLIM load_data_from_csv() docstring: 
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset_csv_file                csv file containing the training data
                                    see /datasets/adult_data.csv for an example
                                    training data stored as a table with N+1 rows and d+1 columns
                                    column 1 is the outcome variable entries must be (-1,1) or (0,1)
                                    column 2 to d+1 are the d input variables
                                    row 1 contains unique names for the outcome variable, and the input variable

    sample_weights_csv_file         csv file containing sample weights for the training data
                                    weights stored as a table with N rows and 1 column
                                    all sample weights must be non-negative

    fold_csv_file                   csv file containing indices of folds for K-fold cross validation
                                    fold indices stored as a table with N rows and 1 column
                                    folds must be integers between 1 to K
                                    if fold_csv_file is None, then we do not use folds

    fold_num                        int between 0 to K, where K is set by the fold_csv_file
                                    let fold_idx be the N x 1 index vector listed in fold_csv_file
                                    samples where fold_idx == fold_num will be used to test
                                    samples where fold_idx != fold_num will be used to train the model
                                    fold_num = 0 means use "all" of the training data (since all values of fold_idx \in [1,K])
                                    if fold_csv_file is None, then fold_num is set to 0

    Returns
    -------
    dictionary containing training data for a binary classification problem with the fields:

     - 'X' N x P matrix of features (numpy.ndarray) with a column of 1s for the '(Intercept)'
     - 'Y' N x 1 vector of labels (+1/-1) (numpy.ndarray)
     - 'variable_names' list of strings containing the names of each feature (list)
     - 'Y_name' string containing the name of the output (optional)
     - 'sample_weights' N x 1 vector of sample weights, must all be positive
