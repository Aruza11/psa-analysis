# psa-analysis

The purpose of the research is to see whether interpretable machine learning models can be helpful in assessing pre-trial risk, in comparison to the Arnold foundation's current methods. Our goal will be to take their pre-trial risk measure (PSA), create our own risk assessment tools using interpretable machine learning methods, and do an empirical comparison.
